## PhD Student in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine

I am a PhD student studying [Statistics at UCI](https://www.stat.uci.edu), advised by [Dr. Volodymyr Minin](https://vnminin.github.io). My research interests include stochastic processes, Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian modeling with applications in infectious disease epidemiology, and statistics education.

My current methodological work focuses on Gauss-Markov stochastic process priors for $R_t$, the effective reproduction number. I am also working on applied projects exploring respiratory virus transmission dynamics in Cambodia and tuberculosis transmission among immunocompromised individuals in Botswana.
